Here O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;\nHere would I touch and handle things unseen,\nHere grasp with firmer hand the eternal grace,\nAnd all my weariness upon Thee lean.\n\n2. Here would I feed upon the bread of God,\nHere drink with Thee the royal wine of heaven;\nHere would I lay aside each earthly load,\nHere taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.\n\n3. This is the hour of banquet and of song;\nThis is the heavenly table spread for me;\nHere let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong\nThe brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.\n\n4. Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;\nThe feast, though not the love, is past and gone;\nThe bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,\nNearer than ever, still my Shield and Sun.\t\n\n5. I have no help but Thine; nor do I need\nAnother arm save Thine to lean upon;\nIt is enough, my Lord, enough indeed,\nMy strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.\n\n6. Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness;\nMine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood;\nHere is my robe, my refuge, and my peace\nThy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord my God.\n\n7. Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,\nYet, passing, points to the glad feast above,\nGiving sweet foretaste of the feastal joy,\nThe Lamb’s great bridal feast of bliss and love.\n","docid":"324"},{"c0Id":"324","c1title":"Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness","c2tunes":"","c4lyrics":"1 Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness,\nleave the gloomy haunts of sadness;\ncome into the daylight's splendour,\nthere with joy thy praises render\nunto him whose grace unbounded\nhath this wondrous banquet founded:\nhigh o'er all the heavens he reigneth,\nyet to dwell with thee he deigneth.\n\n2 Hasten as a bride to meet Him,                                                                                             And with loving reverence greet Him,                                                                               For with words of life immortal,                                                                                 Now He knocketh at thy portal,                                                                                   Haste to ope the gates before Him,                                                                                       Saying while thou dost adore Him,                                                                          Suffer Lord that I receive Thee,                                                                                                  And I never more will leave Thee.\n\n3 Sun, who all my life dost brighten,\nlight, who dost my soul enlighten,\njoy, the sweetest heart e'er knoweth,\nfount, whence all my being floweth,\nat thy feet I cry, my Maker,\nlet me be a fit partaker\nof this blessed food from heaven,\nfor our good, thy glory, given.\n\n4 Jesus, Bread of Life, I pray thee,\nlet me gladly here obey thee;\nnever to my hurt invited,\nbe thy love with love requited:\nfrom this banquet let me measure,\nLord, how vast and deep its treasure;\nthrough the gifts thou here dost give me,\nas thy guest in heaven receive me.\n","docid":"325"},{"c0Id":"325","c1title":"O God of love, to Thee we bow","c2tunes":"","c4lyrics":"1 O God of love, to Thee we bow,\nAnd pray for these before Thee now,\nThat, closely knit in holy vow,\nThey may in Thee be one.\n\n2 When days are filled with pure delight,\nWhen paths are plain and skies are bright,\nWalking by faith and not by sight,\nMay they in Thee be one.\n\n3 When stormy winds fulfill Thy will,\nAnd all their good seems turned to ill,\nThen, trusting Thee completely, still\nMay they in Thee be one.\n\n4 Whate’er in life shall be their share\nOf quickening joy or burdening care,\nIn power to do and grace to bear,\nMay they in Thee be one.\n\n5 Eternal Love, with them abide;                                                          In Thee for ever may they hide,                                                  For even death cannot divide,                                              Those whom Thou makest one.\n","docid":"326"},{"c0Id":"326","c1title":"O Father, all creating","c2tunes":"","c4lyrics":"1 O Father, all creating,\nWhose wisdom, love, and power\nFirst bound two lives together\nIn Eden’s primal hour,\nToday to these Thy children\nThine earliest gifts renew:\nA home by Thee made happy,\nA love by Thee kept true.\n\n2 O Saviour, Guest most bounteous of old in Galilee,                                 Vouchsafe to-day thy presence,                                                                         With these who call on thee;                                                                      Their store of earthly gladness,                                                             Transform to heavenly wine,                                                                              And teach them in the tasting,                                                                                    To know the gift is Thine.\n\n3 O Spirit of the Father,\nBreathe on them from above,\nSo mighty in Thy pureness,\nSo tender in Thy love\nThat, guarded by Thy presence\nAnd kept from strife and sin,\nTheir lives may own thy  guidance\nTheir hearts be ruled by thee.\n\n4 Excerpt thou build it, Father,\nThe house is built in vain;\nExcerpt thou, Savior, bless it,\nThe joy will turn to pain.\nBut nought can breaks a union\nOf hearts in thee made one;\nAnd love thy Spirit hallows\nIs endless love begun.\n","docid":"327"},{"c0Id":"327","c1title":"O Perfect Love, all human thought transcending","c2tunes":"","c4lyrics":"1.
